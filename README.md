My answers to projectEuler problems - https://projecteuler.net/

##Edit:

After submitting my first answer I saw the message about not posting answers outside of Project Euler. Having followed Project Euler for a while you can see the competitive end of the spectrum are the guys trying to solve the latest problem (512 at the time of writing).

With that in mind I will continue to version control my answers and will stop if I ever get halfway to the latest problem. (Likely never to happen...)

If Project Euler get in touch adn ask me to stop I will of course respect their wishes as a fan of the site.
